Template de API Python com Flask e Panda

This project is a log from my tests with Python API development using Flask and Panda.
The original project is located at the blog post (The Right Way to Build an API with Python)[https://towardsdatascience.com/the-right-way-to-build-an-api-with-python-cd08ab285f8f] from James Briggs.
I added some curl calls to help tests.
